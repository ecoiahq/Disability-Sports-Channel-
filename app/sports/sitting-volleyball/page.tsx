              Sitting Volleyball is a Paralympic sport played by athletes with a physical disability. The sport is
              governed by World ParaVolley.
            </p>
            <p>
              The sport is played on a smaller court than standing volleyball, and the net is lower. Athletes must have
              at least one buttock in contact with the floor whenever playing the ball.
