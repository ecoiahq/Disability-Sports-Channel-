          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-white">4. Sharing Your Data</h2>
          <p className="text-white">

          <p className="text-white">
            While our primary data storage and processing occur within the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA), some
            of our service providers may be located outside of these regions. In such cases, we ensure that data
            transfers comply with the UK GDPR by implementing safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, to
            protect your information.
          </p>
